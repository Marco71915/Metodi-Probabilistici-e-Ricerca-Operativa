# Probabilistic Methods & Operations Research Exercises

This repository contains a collection of **original exercises and simulations** related to the course "Probabilistic Methods and Operations Research". All exercises were created or adapted by me to deepen understanding of probability theory, expected values, variance, stochastic processes, and operations research problems.

## Content Overview
The repository includes exercises in different formats:

- **Excel files** for calculations and simulations (e.g., `Attesa dal medico e troncamento del buffer.xlsx`, `Esercizio Macellaio LB.xlsx`)  
- **Word documents** for problem statements and solutions (e.g., `II problema del Barbiere.docx`, `Legge debole dei grandi numeri II Rumore.docx`)  
- **PowerPoint slides** for theoretical exercises (e.g., `Metodi Lez 24.1 Valore atteso del rapporto di variabili aleatorie.pptx`)  
- **Matlab projects** for simulations and computational exercises  
- **Video recordings** showing Matlab simulations and step-by-step solutions (e.g., `DistribuzioneDellaSomma.mp4`, `Weibull.mp4`)  

## How to Use
You can download the files to practice exercises or study the provided solutions and simulations. Matlab projects can be opened and run in Matlab to explore the simulations interactively.

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical application of probability and operations research concepts through **self-created exercises**, computational simulations in Matlab, and visual explanations.

## License
All exercises, simulations, and materials in this repository are created by the author and can be freely used for educational purposes.
